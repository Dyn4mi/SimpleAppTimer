This application will not work the first time you run it. It will instead create a text file called cfg.txt
Open that file, and fill the fields to configurate this application.
All backslashes in the configuration values should be escaped with another backslash.
Example -> /path/to/exe.exe should be //path//to//exe.exe 
Otherwise this will not work.
